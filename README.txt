Comments:

* Title: what about "Demystify GPU Microarchitecture to Tune SGEMM Performance" ?
* Is it possible to add a roofline figure in section 5.2.3 "Upper Bound Analysis". That would be great!
* Could we call "sample programs" as "nanobenchmarks"?
* More explanation of the listed small observations in sec 3.3.
* Add more references
* Tell the difference between the similar opcodes, e.g. LDG and LDS.64. Maybe list all mentioned opcodes' meanings in a table.
* 

Notice:

* I'm modifying section 3.


Suggesting Modifications:

* change "e.g." to "such as"
* Add full name for the first mention
* Change "matrix width" to "matrix size" in experiment figures.
* Unify cuBLAS, not CUBLAS
