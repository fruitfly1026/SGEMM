In this paper, we have presented the fastest implementation of SGEMM on Kepler Gk110 architecture.
The optimized TN is $3104$ Gflop/s and efficiency is $3104/3520=88\%$, cublas's TN is $2216 Gflops$,
efficiency is $2216/3520=63\%$. Our TN implementation is 25\% higher than cublas's TN. 
The optimized NN achieves $2938$ Gflop/s ($83\%$ efficiency), cublas's NN achieves $2509$($71\%$
efficiency). Our NN is $12\%$ than Cublas's NN.
The performance boost is achieved on the basis of high FFMA throughput and series of optimizations.
These optimizations include register bank conflict eliminating, FFMA dual issue scheduling, choosing
proper width of global load and shared memory load instructions and so on.

This study includes detailed benchmarking of the GPU instruction issue system that
reveals how control code influences throughput. Our assembler open a door to optimize Nvidia GPU
code in native machine level, and our experience and performance model are a good case study of it.
In future, we will develop automatic compiling tools, which could generate higher performance code.
