\subsection{Methodology}

We propose a methodology to demystify GPU microarchitecture features and correlate them with performance. 
The workflow consists of three major components: CUDA binary tools, a instruction solver, and a deliberate microbenchmar
k\jled{meticulously benchmarking (because it is a benchmarking process not just build and use a benchmark)}. 
We build two program sets, sample programs and microbenchmark.
Each sample program is a synthetic PTX file which generates specific instructions as our reference in the instruction so
lver. \jled{xiuxia, check correctness}
We leverage CUDA binary tools ({\tt cuobjdump} and {\tt nvdiasm}) to generate disassembly codes from sample programs or 
libraries. 
A library might provide a high coverage of instruction sets. For example, the CUBLAS library contains almost all instruc
tions used in SGEMM routines. As introduced in section~\ref{sec:cuda}, these generated assembly files ({\em sass}) provi
de a instruction encoded number to be cracked.

The instruction solver takes the assembly files as input to decode $64$-bits binary representation of each instruction. 
We design a set of algorithms to solve all fields of the binary instruction. These fields include various {\em operands}
, {\em opcodes} and {\em modifiers}. The solver retrieves the undocumented ISA specification, which is used to implement
 an native assembler. Then, we design deliberate microbenchmarks and leverage the assembler to tune code at assembly lan
guage level. In the end, the tuning process will lead to some practical observations on the correlation between microarc
hitecture and performance.
