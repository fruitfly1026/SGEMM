\subsection{GPU ISA Encoding Solver and Assembler}

The ISA encoding information that is necessary to build an assembler and public for CPUs does not released by GPU vendors.
Previous third-party work to build GPU assemblers~\cite{decuda,asfermi,maxas} also
involves cracking GPU ISA encodings, whereas no cracking process is explicitly reported.
Our solver is proposed to make cracking GPU ISA encodings simple, automatic, and portable to future GPUs.

Operands could be registers (e.g. {\tt R5}),
global memory (e.g. {\tt [R6+0x20]}), constant memory (e.g. {\tt C[0x2][0x40]}), shared memory (e.g. {\tt [0x50]}), immediate values (e.g. {\tt 0x9} and {\tt1.5}), or predicate registers (e.g. {\tt P3})~\cite{ptx2015isa}.
We observe that an operand name always includes a number, thus an operand can be inferred by its name.
Since a number's encoding can be literally explained, the operand encoding is relatively easy to recognize.
For example, the register operand {\tt R5} can be inferred from $101$ in binary format, while the immediate value {\tt 0x9} is $1001$. 
%Besides, the fixed lengths of these fields allow us to determine their positions \jled{and lengths, don't need to specify lengths here.} relatively easily and hence to encode them. 
The encodings of opcodes and modifiers are mnemonic symbols which can not be literally explained,
a heuristic algorithm on a pruned search space is designed to crack the positions of them.
Besides, Modifiers are instruction-sensitive, modifiers in the same type may have different encodings for different instructions. 
As an example, masks of type-size modifier for instructions {\tt LD} and {\tt LDG} are in different binary positions. 
Hence, every instruction's modifier need to be processed independently.

% Figure~\ref{fig:imm} shows encoding format of {\tt IADD} instruction with {\tt opcode}, {\tt operand}, and {\tt modifier} fields.
%We express a native assembly instruction in a struct variable $inst$, which is the input of our solver.
%In this way, we generate real assembly instruction and their 64-bit encoding, which is the input of solver algorithm.
%We disassmble libcublas.so to generate instruction and their corresponing 64-bit encodings. There are $1537123$ different encodings of cublas 7.0 library in total.



\subsubsection{Opcode and Modifier Solvers}
% \subsubsection{Opcode Encoding Solver}
We design a heuristic algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{algo:opcode}) to crack {\tt opcode} encodings by detecting their bit positions.
Opcode solver takes $N$ diassembly instructions generated from PTX samples as the input and outputs all opcode positions as $opBits$.
Each diassembly instruction $inst$ integrates its 64-bit binary code, name, operand types, and operand values as a structure.
Take the $IADD$ instruction in Equation~\ref{eq:iadd} for example, its binary code is $0x4800000000201c03$, name is $IADD$, operand types and values are represented two tuples: $\{ R,R,R \}$ and $\{ 0,2,0 \}$.
By flipping the 64 bits one-by-one, we determine whether each bit belongs to opcode.
Each flip generates a new binary code $\widehat{enc}$ which is disassembled by nvdisasm to a new instruction $\widehat{inst}$.
If $\widehat{inst}$ is valid and its instruction name is changed, this bit is in opcode field.

% is to write intermediate codes based on NVIDIA PTX syntax, and generate encoding by NVIDIA toolchain.
% Subsequently, the opcodes can be achieved by stripping out operand masks, and
% flags can be found by stripping out both opcodes and operand masks.
% However, the uncompleteness of NVIDIA document hinders us from finding out all the opcodes and instruction modifiers. 
% Another feasible way is to find the bit positions which represents opcode, then
% enumerate all the possible binary combinations after stripping out operand masks as Algorithm~\ref{algo:opcode} shows.

From our results of NVIDIA Tesla K20m, we find that the top $10$ bits and the low $2$ bits represent opcode on GPU Kepler architecture.
This algorithm narrows the opcode search space from $64$ to $12$ bits with an acceptable running time of $O(64N)$, where $N$ is disassembly input generated by PTX samples.
We only enumerate possible opcodes in the pruned $12$ bits and identify all valid ones.

We use a similar algorithm to detect modifier bits.
For each valid opcode, we detect the rest $52$ bits by flipping and initially setting them to $0$s.
% Thus, we only enumerate these opcode bits which generate an acceptable search space. Finally, we find 
% the minimal opcode without any flags.

\subsubsection{Operand Solver}
% \subsubsection{Operand Position Solver}
Each opcode may have different numbers and types of operands, we had better probe operand positions by both opcode and operand type. 
For example, {\tt IADD} has three kinds of operand types: {\tt IADD} R1,R2,R3; {\tt FADD} R1, R2,
C[0x0][0x40]; {\tt IADD} R1, R2, 0.5;. We represent the operand type as a string:
RRR, RRC, RRI for {\tt IADD} instruction, where R, C and I denotes register, constant
memory and immediate respectively. Then we probe the bit positions for each type.
The main idea is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algo:operand}.

A modifier defines a specific behavior for an instruction. For example,
{\tt LD} instruction has type-size modifiers, such as {\tt .u8}, {\tt .s8}, {\tt .u16}, {\tt .32}, {\tt .64} and {\tt 
.128}. {\tt LD} also has cache operation modifiers, such as {\tt .CS}(cache streaming) and {\tt .cg}(cache at global 
level). Modifiers are much more complicated because its position spans across the reminding bits and one instruction 
may have more than one kinds of modifiers. By excluding both opcode and operand mask, there remain around $24$ bits. In 
order to reduce the search space, we observe that the default value for an modifier is $0$. That is, the modifier works when at 
least one bit is set. We can check possible positions of modifiers by greedily setting the remaining bits one by one to 
observe whether flags will change.

      \If {ith = whichChange(origin,new) > 0}
      \State pos[origin.op][origin.oprdType][ith].append(j)
      \LineComment{Mark <op, oprdType> is visited}
      \State visited[origin.op][origin.oprdType] = 1

%Algorithm~\ref{algo:int_solver} shows the pseudocode for immediate operand decoding process. 
%The basic idea is matching the binary encoding of an operand in $64$-bit instruction encoding and finding
%position until the position is unique. The input instructions are from disassembly codes.
%First, we randomly pick up an instruction that has the field we want to probe and represent the field in binary by its 
%name. Second, we match the operand binary in $64$-bit instruction encoding and find possible positions. Third, we 
%intersect current candidates with previous ones. %If the number of candidates is $1$, we find the position. 
%The unique position is found when the number of candidates is $1$.
%Otherwise, 
%we set the current candidate to the previous one and randomly pick up next instruction to repeat the procedure.
%Other operand types such as register operand can use similar routine by matching the corresponding operand binary.
%Once the operand position is found, we need to probe or verify the length of the operand encoding. Some are easy to be
%deduced. For example, each thread can use at most $256=2^{8}$ registers, we could predict the length of register 
%operand mask to be $8$.
%However, other operand types like immediate $0x48$ or subscript of constant memory $C[0x2][0x05]$, are more complicated 
%to predict. Our solution is to set the bits from the position bit by bit to check whether the operand value grows
%as expected. For instance, by using Algorithm~\ref{algo:int_solver}, we find out that the immediate operand position 
%of {\tt IADD RX, RY, 0ximm} (the RX and RY are arbitrary register operands, 0ximm is an immediate operand) is at bit $23$ 
%as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:imm}. As specified in~\cite{cuda2015programming}, NVIDIA GPU uses little-endian 
%representation, then we set the bits higher than the $23$ to $1$ bit by bit, and observe the disassembled code. 
%Immediate value increases continuely until reaches value {\tt 0x7ffff}, which means that $41\sim23$ is for integer 
%immediate.%No {\tt fffff} immediate was got even if we set bit $42$ to be $1$.
