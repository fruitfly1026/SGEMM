\subsection{GPU ISA Encoding Solver and GPU Assembler}
We need GPU ISA encoding information in order to build a GPU assembler.
However, GPU vendors do not release these information as CPU vendors do.
Previous third-party GPU assembler work~\cite{decuda,asfermi,maxas} also
involves cracking GPU ISA encoding, however no cracking process is described.
It seems that they do it handy. CPU instruction decoding~\cite{collberg1997reverse,engler2000derive} use CPU assembler to generate CPU ISA encoding automatically. Our solver is proposed to make cracking GPU ISA
encoding easy,automatic and portable to future GPU.
%We do not know whether their methods is able to crack ISA encodings of next generation GPU.
%\jled{How sample programs used in here? No mention.}

We write a simple PTX instruction generator to generate PTX instruction with various modifiers.
Then compile the PTX files to cubin files by {\tt ptxas}, and disassemble them by {\tt cuobjdump} to generate the real assemblies. 
Figure~\ref{fig:imm} shows an assembly instruction consisting of three fields: {\tt opcode}, {\tt operand}, and {\tt modifier}. We express these information in a struct
variable $instMap$, which is the input of our solver.
%In this way, we generate real assembly instruction and their 64-bit encoding, which is the input of solver algorithm.
%We disassmble libcublas.so to generate instruction and their corresponing 64-bit encodings. There are $1537123$ different encodings of cublas 7.0 library in total.

\subsubsection{Opcode Encoding Solver}
Unlike operands, opcodes and modifiers do not show their encodings literally. One possible way to crack the operand 
encodings is to write intermediate codes
based on NVIDIA PTX syntax, and generate encoding by NVIDIA toolchain.
%Then, opcode can be got by stripping out operand mask, and flag can be found by stripping out both opcode and operand 
%mask. 
Subsequently, the opcodes can be achieved by stripping out operand masks, and
flags can be found by stripping out both opcodes and operand masks.
However, the uncompleteness of NVIDIA document hinders us from finding out all the opcodes and instruction modifiers. 
Another feasible way is to enumerate all the possible binary combinations after stripping out operand masks.
%In general, each instruction has three register operands, and one 4-bit predicate register, thus $64-8*3-4=36$ bits are left 
%to probe.
In fact, we can further prune the search space by recognizing possible bit positions by algorithm~\ref{algo:opcode}. By 
randomly probing bit by bit, we find that both the top $10$ bits and lower $2$ bits represent opcode on Kepler GPU.
%and other bits represent flags. 
Thus, we only enumerate these opcode bits which generate an acceptable search space. Finally, we find 
the minimal opcode without any flags. The time complexity is O(N*64), where N
is disassembly input generated by PTX, $64$ represents probing flipping 64
bits.

      \State \textbf {Input:} instMap (A map of instructions and their 64-bit encodings)

	  %\LineComment {fetch an instruction from generated database \jled{what's the database?}}
      \State $inst \gets instMap[i]$
      \State $enc \gets inst.enc64$
	  \LineComment {check each bit of $enc$ for opcode}
      \For {$j \gets 0, 63$}
      %\LineComment {if bit $j$ not operand bit and its value is 0} % \jled{what about enc[j]!=0? No need to check if it is opcode?}}
      %\If {notOprd($enc[j]$) and $enc[j] = 0$}
      \LineComment {flip bit $j$}
      \State nEnc = xor($enc, 1<<j$)
	  \LineComment {disassemble new encoding nEnc}
      \State nInst=nvdisasm(nEnc)
	  \LineComment {bit $j$ belongs to an opcode if it is changed }
      \If { isvalid(nInst) and $nInst.op\neq inst.op$}
      \State put($j$, $opBits$)
      %\EndIf
      \EndIf
      \EndFor
      \EndFor
      \State \textbf{Return} opBits %\jled{All instructions' opcodes are stored in opBits?}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Operand Position Solver}
An operand could be register({\tt R5}), 
global memory({\tt [R6+0x20]}), constant memory({\tt C[0x2][0x40]}), shared memory ({\tt [0x50]}),
immediate values({\tt 0x9} and{\tt1.5}), or predicate register({\tt P3})~\cite{ptx2015isa}. %represented by different .
And we observe that the name of an operand is always related with a number, so the encoding of an operand can be inferred by its name.
For instance, the register operand {\tt R5} is inferred as $101$ in binary format, while the immediate value {\tt 0x9} is $1001$. 
%Besides, the fixed lengths of these fields allow us to determine their positions \jled{and lengths, don't need to specify lengths here.} relatively easily and hence to encode them. 
The encodings of opcodes and modifiers are mnemonic symbols which can not be expressed as binary literally. 
They must be enumerated in their encoding space, and we design a heuristic algorithm on a pruned search space to
determine the position of opcodes and modifiers.
Modifiers are instruction-sensitive, that is, modifiers in the same type may be different encodings for different instructions. 
For instance, masks of type-size
modifier for {\tt LD} and {\tt LDG} are at different binary positions. Hence, we process each instruction's modifier separately.

      \State \textbf {Input:} instMap (A map of instructions and their 64-bit encodings)
      \State \textbf {Onput:} Operand positions for each instruction

	  %\LineComment {fetch an instruction from generated database \jled{what's the database?}}
      \State $inst \gets instMap[i]$
      \State $enc \gets inst.enc64$
	  \LineComment {check each bit of $enc$ for opcode}
      \For {$j \gets 0, 63$}
      %\LineComment {if bit $j$ not operand bit and its value is 0} % \jled{what about enc[j]!=0? No need to check if it is opcode?}}
      %\If {notOprd($enc[j]$) and $enc[j] = 0$}
      \LineComment {flip bit $j$}
      \State nEnc = xor($enc, 1<<j$)
	  \LineComment {disassemble new encoding nEnc}
      \State nInst=nvdisasm(nEnc)
	  \LineComment {bit $j$ belongs to an operand }
      \If { isvalid(nInst) and $nInst.op = inst.op$ and change() }
      \State put($j$, $operandBits$)
      %\EndIf
      \EndIf
      \EndFor
      \EndFor
      \State \textbf{Return} opBits %\jled{All instructions' opcodes are stored in opBits?}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
%Algorithm~\ref{algo:int_solver} shows the pseudocode for immediate operand decoding process. 
%The basic idea is matching the binary encoding of an operand in $64$-bit instruction encoding and finding
%position until the position is unique. The input instructions are from disassembly codes.
%First, we randomly pick up an instruction that has the field we want to probe and represent the field in binary by its 
%name. Second, we match the operand binary in $64$-bit instruction encoding and find possible positions. Third, we 
%intersect current candidates with previous ones. %If the number of candidates is $1$, we find the position. 
%The unique position is found when the number of candidates is $1$.
%Otherwise, 
%we set the current candidate to the previous one and randomly pick up next instruction to repeat the procedure.
%Other operand types such as register operand can use similar routine by matching the corresponding operand binary.
%Once the operand position is found, we need to probe or verify the length of the operand encoding. Some are easy to be
%deduced. For example, each thread can use at most $256=2^{8}$ registers, we could predict the length of register 
%operand mask to be $8$.
%However, other operand types like immediate $0x48$ or subscript of constant memory $C[0x2][0x05]$, are more complicated 
%to predict. Our solution is to set the bits from the position bit by bit to check whether the operand value grows
%as expected. For instance, by using Algorithm~\ref{algo:int_solver}, we find out that the immediate operand position 
%of {\tt IADD RX, RY, 0ximm} (the RX and RY are arbitrary register operands, 0ximm is an immediate operand) is at bit $23$ 
%as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:imm}. As specified in~\cite{cuda2015programming}, NVIDIA GPU uses little-endian 
%representation, then we set the bits higher than the $23$ to $1$ bit by bit, and observe the disassembled code. 
%Immediate value increases continuely until reaches value {\tt 0x7ffff}, which means that $41\sim23$ is for integer 
%immediate.%No {\tt fffff} immediate was got even if we set bit $42$ to be $1$.  
\subsubsection{Modifier Encoding Solver}
A modifier defines a specific behavior for an instruction. For example,
{\tt LD} instruction has type-size modifiers, such as {\tt .u8}, {\tt .s8}, {\tt .u16}, {\tt .32}, {\tt .64} and {\tt 
.128}. {\tt LD} also has cache operation modifiers, such as {\tt .CS}(cache streaming) and {\tt .cg}(cache at global 
level). Modifiers are much more complicated because its position spans across the reminding bits and one instruction 
may have more than one kinds of modifiers. By excluding both opcode and operand mask, there remain around $24$ bits. In 
order to reduce the search space, we observe that the default value for an modifier is $0$. That is, the modifier works when at 
least one bit is set. We can check possible positions of modifiers by greedily setting the remaining bits one by one to 
observe whether flags will change.
