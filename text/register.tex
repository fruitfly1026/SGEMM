To allocate registers for $A$ column, $B$ row, and $C$ sub-matrix as in Algorithm~\ref{gemm}, we have three objectives:
correctness, no bank conflict, and tight register indices.
{\tt LDG.128} restricts four words alignment for registers.
Since NVIDIA GPU does not have $128$-bit registers, 
four consecutive $32$-bit registers {\tt RN}, {\tt RN+1}, {\tt RN+2}, and {\tt RN+3} will be an equivalence for a 128-bit
register.
%a $128$-bit load instruction ({\tt LDG.128}) writes the data to four consecutive $32$-bit registers {\tt RN}, {\tt RN+1}, {\tt RN+2}, and {\tt RN+3} given one destination register $RN$.
% in order to use $128$-bit load, one destination register $RN$ is given,
% results will be written to
% four $32$-bit registers: {\tt RN}, {\tt RN+1}, {\tt RN+2}, {\tt RN+3}.
We discover an undocumented restriction that $N\mod4=0$, otherwise illegal instruction errors will be reported.
% It's not hard to understand this restriction,
The four words alignment restriction for {\tt LDG.128} simplifies hardware logic and cuts down power.
Since we use {\tt LDG.128} to load $A$ and $B$, there are two bank allocation choices limited by $N\mod4=0$ restriction and Kepler's bank distribution (Table~\ref{tab:reg}).
We assume allocate bank of $A$ matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}$,
   bank of $B$ $\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reg}, two choices left for $C$,
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 0  \end{bmatrix}$ and
$\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 2  \end{bmatrix}$.
The $2\times2=4$ bank patterns for SGEMM are equivalent in performance, then we arbitrarily
choose $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}$ $\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$
    $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 0  \end{bmatrix}$ for $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.
We use four colors to represent the four banks respectively and show the register allocation when computing a $12 \times 12$ sub-matrix of C in Figure~\ref{fig:reg}.
% We have $2\times2$ bank patterns for SGEMM, these four patterns are equivalent in performance,
%To allocate actual register index, we choose continuous register index so that register index do not get too big to exceed 255. 
For actual register index allocation, we choose continuous register indices so that they will not exceed $255$.
It can be verified that every $C_{ij}$, $A_i$ and $B_j$ have different banks in Figure~\ref{fig:reg}, thus register bank conflicts are successfully avoided.
% for example $C_{01}$'s color is white, $A_0$'s color is green and $B_1$'s color is red, .
