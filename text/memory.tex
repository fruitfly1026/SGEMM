\subsection{Memory Movement}
% According to the optimization observation on memory access suggested by microbenchmark,
According to our benchmarking observations, we use {\tt LDG.128} to load data from global memory through texture cache
and {\tt LDS.64} to load data from shared memory.
Additional reasons to adopt them in SGEMM kernel are:
First, {\tt LDG.128} reduces load instructions, hence reduces {\tt non-FFMA}s. %\jled{use load instead of non-FFMA. Use non-FFMA seems complicated.}
In the inner loop of Algorithm~\ref{gemm}, we need three {\tt LDG.128}s instead of twelve {\tt LDG.32}s to read twelve
words from a $A$ column. Second, the shared memory transaction size of a warp is at most
$256$ bytes, which forces {\tt LDS.128} memory requests being split into
multiple transactions.
As we analyzed in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}, {\tt LDS.128} has a lower bandwidth than {\tt LDS.64}, which bounds SGEMM performance.
